## General

### What is the Moderation Module?
The Moderation Module helps you manage your server efficiently by automating actions like banning, kicking, and muting users, as well as tracking moderation actions in logs.

### How do I access the Moderation Configuration panel?
To access the moderation configuration, use the `/config` command in Discord. From there, you can enable or disable the module, configure roles, set a logging channel, and adjust your reply style.

## Configuration Options

### How do I enable or disable the Moderation Module?
In the configuration panel, you can toggle the **Moderation Module** on or off by using the available options. If enabled, all related moderation features will be active in your server.

### How can I configure the moderator roles?
The moderator roles can be set under the **Moderator Roles** section. You can specify which roles should be allowed to use moderation commands like banning, kicking, and muting. For example, you might have roles like `@Core Team`, `@Management`, and `@Moderator`.

### What is the "Reply Style" setting?
The **Reply Style** determines how the bot responds to moderation actions. You can choose between different reply formats:
- **Embed**: The bot replies with a rich embed containing the action details.
- **Plain**: The bot responds with a simple text message.

### How do I set up a moderation logging channel?
To track all moderation actions, set a **Logging Channel**. This is where all actions like bans, kicks, and warnings will be logged for easy tracking. Ensure the specified channel is accessible to the bot.

## Troubleshooting

### The Moderation Module isn’t working. What should I do?
1. Make sure the Moderation Module is enabled in the configuration.
2. Double-check that the bot has the necessary permissions in your logging channel.
3. Ensure your moderator roles have been correctly set in the configuration.

### How can I change the reply style or logging channel?
You can change these settings at any time by revisiting the Moderation Configuration panel through the `/config` command. Simply adjust the options for **Reply Style** and **Logging Channel** to your preference.
