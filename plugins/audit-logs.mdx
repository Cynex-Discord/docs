## General

### What is Audit Logging?
Audit Logging allows you to track and record important actions taken within your server, such as member bans, kicks, and role changes. This helps maintain transparency and accountability for server management.

### How do I configure Audit Logging?
You can configure audit logging through the `/config` command. Here, you can enable or disable the logging, and set a channel to log all audit actions.

## Configuration Options

### How do I enable or disable Audit Logging?
Audit Logging can be toggled on or off from the configuration panel. When enabled, all significant actions taken by moderators will be logged to the designated channel. You can disable it at any time if you no longer wish to track these actions.

### How do I set up an Audit Log Channel?
You can specify a channel where all audit logs will be sent. This channel should be designated to only allow the bot to send messages, and it should be easily accessible to administrators for tracking actions.

## Troubleshooting

### Audit Logging isn’t working. What should I do?
1. Ensure Audit Logging is enabled in the configuration.
2. Check that the bot has the necessary permissions to send messages in the audit log channel.
3. Make sure the channel is set to the correct one and that it exists.

### How can I change the Audit Log Channel?
You can change the Audit Log Channel by revisiting the Audit Logging Configuration panel through the `/config` command. Simply update the **Audit Log Channel** option with the desired channel.
